SHUBH: 
HI everyone! I'm learning Git, and here is my first content for commit...
So, what should I do next?
Shall I learn Chef, Docker and Kubernetes?

SHUBHA:
Well, I'm a 28 yeras old s/w engineer having 34 months of experience in the industry as an S/W Support Engineer.
I know Java, Selenium, Manual testing and somwhat of automation testing.
Looking for a change in domain hence learning Devops, DSA and Frontend(intermidiate level).
So what do you think?

SHANKHA:
Goodd Morning!!! 
That's good. So before learning Chef, Devops and Kubernetes I would suggest you to learn the following:
1) Learn the history. Why devops, Source code management.
2) Then go for Linux and then Networking.
3) Then learn about git(which you are onn currently) so assuming you have done those things.
4) Then the tools- we can discuss this later on.. First finish git.
