New code
public static void main( String[] args)
{
	Scanner in = new Scanner( System.in);
	int number = in.nextInt();
	
	int i=0;
	int rem=0;
	int sum=0;
	while (n > i){
	rem = n % 10;
	sum= sum*10 + rem;
	n = n/10;	
	i++;
	}
	System.out.println(sum);
}

some important work that client asked urgently so I had to put my previos file in stash
